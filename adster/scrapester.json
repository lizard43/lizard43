      "description": "Up for sale is a Williams Pinbot Pinball Machine.  Manufactured in 1986/1987, this is a space-themed pinball with simple rules. Key shots include the ramp, drop targets, and a vortex ramp. Also has multi-ball.\\n\\nOverall, this machine is in great shape with only normal signs of use. \\nPlayfield looks beautiful and backglass  is in wonderful shape. Machine has been recently serviced with new bumper rubbers, lights replaced with cooler and lower wattage #47 bulbs. It is fully cleaned, working 100\\u0025 and ready to go.  \\n\\nAlso, the battery board has been replaced with a remote battery pack, so no more worrying about leaky batteries destroying the CPU.  In addition, the notorious unprotected bridge rectifier issue has been fixed with new fuse systems installed for added protection. Will come with original service manual.  \\n\\nIf interested please contact me. Pickup in the Brandon / Valrico area or buyer arranges freight.\\n\\nPlease don't just ask if it is available and not follow up. If ad is up then it is available. I will likely ignore just \\",

The game gives the guys something to do when they arent working, and the proceeds help others.  I did this many years ago and it was a very successful event.  I rotate the game into another fire station every 60 days.  I need two or three more machines (FIRE!) due to the sheer number of fire stations there are.  I cant pay top dollar because this is for non profit.  I restore each of these games before they are placed so that they look good and are less likely to fail.  I of course pay for all the repairs.  There is NO cost to the firefighters, other than paying fifty cents (or donating $.50) to a charity.
