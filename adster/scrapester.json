      "description": "The Walking Dead Remastered pinball machine by Stern Pinball Limited Edition (LE) (LIMITED TO ONLY 500 UNITS!) $12,999 + FREE SHIPPING Premium Edition $9,699 + FREE SHIPPING Trades Accepted & We Can Ship To Anywhere In The USA IN STOCK - READY TO SHIP ORDER YOURS TODAY FROM FLIP N OUT PINBALL flipnoutpinball.com [hidden information] [hidden information] [hidden information] [hidden information] [hidden information] [hidden information] Stern Pinball, Inc., the largest designer and manufacturer of pinball games in the world, in partnership with AMC Networks revealed and released The Walking Dead Remastered – a technologically advanced version of one of the most beloved pinball games of all time featuring one of the most well-known franchises in the world, AMC’s The Walking Dead. This property has captivated global audiences since its television premiere in 2010. The hit TV series, spin-off shows, video games, merchandise, and more have reshaped the modern landscape of horror storytelling. Powered by Stern’s new SPIKE 3 technology platform, Stern Pinball is excited to bring to life The Walking Dead Remastered to the current generation of pinball players, taking them on an epic journey through legendary moments from the series as they fight to survive the apocalypse. The Walking Dead Remastered pinball game is available now in Premium and Limited Edition (LE) models, along with a full line of accessories available soon. In Stern Pinball’s The Walking Dead Remastered pinball game, players will battle walkers and survive key scenes from The Walking Dead in an immersive physical pinball experience like none other. The development team, led by John Borg, the designer of the original game, have created a modern version of the original masterpiece. The playfield features enhanced versions of the “Cell Block C” Prison building, bicycle girl ramp, and an interactive Well Walker toy. The fan-favorite crossbow device that shoots a pinball has been re-engineered and updated for increased precision and flexibility in gameplay. The game also features new RGB lighting and illuminated zombie heads on the slingshots. Extra care and attention to detail have gone into every facet of The Walking Dead Remastered, honoring the original masterpiece by John Borg and Lyman F. Sheats, Jr. The game includes an updated version of the revolutionary ruleset that introduced a new mode structure and risk-reward elements that have stood the test of time. Through the iconic Prison, Well Walker, and Blood Bath multiballs and the depth of each Dead Feature mode (Barn, CDC, Riot, Tunnel, and Arena), players are immersed in a pinball battle that can ultimately leave a “Last Man Standing”... that is, if you’re able to survive the Horde and escape Terminus along your adventure. In The Walking Dead Remastered, players will be introduced to newly developed visuals that blend high-quality video elements with a vibrant painterly art style, both on the cabinet and on the display. Extraordinary care has been taken to ensure the new visuals mirror scenes from the classic game, while also going beyond with additional updates. Software enhancements will introduce additional game rules, including new custom audio call-outs from actors Michael Rooker (Merle) and Danai Gurira (Michonne). Players will also experience Stern’s Insider Connected (IC) system that provides advanced connectivity features, enabling real-time engagement and a more connected experience for all. The Walking Dead Remastered features Stern’s next-generation SPIKE 3 technology platform, which includes a larger 18.5” full HD display with true color depth, along with a more powerful processor, and a new high fidelity immersive audio system. Players will get to experience completely overhauled 3D-rendered graphics and custom animations that pay homage to the dot matrix display from the original pinball machine. SPIKE 3 electronics also feature more efficient power handling, improved Wi-Fi support, and wireless headphone capabilities. This release will also feature an updated cabinet lighting customization system designed to allow for internal and external expression lighting on all versions of the game. Limited to 500 games globally, the highly collectible Limited Edition model includes the updated Expression Lighting SystemTM and Speaker Expression Lighting System with The Walking Dead-themed game effects, a full-color mirrored backglass, full-color high-definition cabinet decals, exclusive custom The Walking Dead Remastered pinball armor, a custom designer-autographed bottom arch, upgraded audio system, anti-reflection pinball playfield glass, shaker motor, a sequentially numbered plaque, a signed Certificate of Authenticity, and a digital Insider Connected LE owner’s badge on registration. “The Walking Dead is one of the most memorable and influential pinball games in our time, and we’re proud of the entire Stern team for elevating this iconic game onto our new platform,” said Seth Davis, President & CEO of Stern Pinball. “We’re always looking to create new immersive and thrilling gameplay experiences in pinball, and there’s no better way to do that than by bringing The Walking Dead back from the dead and to an entirely new generation of zombie lovers and pinball players.”",

Scroll down to find the seller information with my photo. Next, click on seller details, scroll to the bottom of that page and you'll see all of my listings.

Cash only upon pick up. Mr. Jones Watch Ricochet $325 Get lost in time with the Ricochet watch. Ricochet is inspired by the world of the pinball arcade and was designed for us by Ryan Claytor. The three metallic robots, engrossed in the action of the pinball machine were each gilded by hand in a different metallic foil palladium, 20ct. citron gold and 22ct. rose gold. The scoreboard of the game shows you the hours and minutes. This watch has a jump hour movement, so you'll need to watch closely to see the hour change - blink and you'll miss it! Ricochet was a real labor of love to produce, each watch representing many hours of work by our small, talented team. • Medium / unisex size • Sapphire glass (hard-wearing) • TY2709 20 jewel automatic mechanical movement • Jump hour movement • Waterproof! Rated 5ATM • 316L stainless steel case • 18mm stainless steel strap About the Artist • Ryan Claytor • Ryan, who has a deep love for pinball, considers the links between the game and time: • “Pinball is essentially a game of timing: flip a fraction of a second too soon or too late and you'll miss your intended target. • In its more transcendent moments though, a game of pinball can almost mystically remove the player from any concept of time. • When engrossed in a game where shots are being hit, progress being made and previously locked achievements are realized, pinball has the capacity to transport the player out of time entirely. • Rest assured, though, that \"Ricochet\" will be a faithful temporal reminder once you resurface from this engrossing experience!” • Ryan Claytor is an award-winning American Comics Creator and professor at Michigan State University (MSU) where he teaches Comics Studio courses, heads the Comic Art and Graphic Novel interdisciplinary minor and directs the MSU Comics Forum. • Claytor creates non-fiction comics that, most recently, focus on the history of electro-mechanical coin-operated amusement devices (pinball and arcade games manufactured prior to the implementation of solid-state technology in 1978). • Additionally, he is the Host and Producer of the MSU Comic Art and Graphic Novel Podcast and designs custom neon signs.",

This game has undergone a ground up restoration, with the cabinet being repainted using professional stencils back to its original graphics. The game has been cleaned and restored mechanically and plays great! The playfield is in great condition, as is the back glass. This game was originally purchased from an operator who removed it from his route back in the day, after only a few months, due to someone damaging the front door in an attempt to break it. The game only has 13,xxx plays on it, due to being in storage for 50 years. The game has a new reproduction front door, legs, and many other parts. It is a beautiful game which must be seen in person and played. If interested, please contact me and I can put you in touch with the owner for any arrangements. Asking $1,900 OBO. Cash only. Pick up in Flagler Beach, FL.",

      "description": "Not sure what it was originally, I forgot, but I converted it to NBA Jam a number of years ago. I removed the parts, but left the Jamma harness and power harness in place. The control panel base is included, but the top isn’t, but it’s pretty easy to cut a new one. I can even throw in a quality piece of wood for you to do it yourself. Cabinet fits a 27” monitor. This would make a great MAME cabinet or for whatever you want to build it as. Nice wide control panel could work for a myriad of four player coin muncher games like TMNT and Simpsons. The cabinet is in very nice shape overall.",

      "description": "I'm listing my Gottlieb Abra Ca Dabra after owning it for several years. I love it but it is taking up limited space and it doesn't get much play anymore. I purchased this game shopped from the Pinball Dudes in Jupiter, FL. They did a full shop job and the game plays great, pretty much exactly like it did when I brought it home. It is hi-tapped. It's not in perfect shape, the cab and the playfield have some wear from being on location for many years though I do think for almost 79,000 plays it looks very good. Please refer to the pictures. A couple of the plastics are chipped as well. As far as mechanical issues are concerned, a few of the playfield and backbox light sockets have gone out over time and need replacing (I am 99% sure it is sockets since most of the game is LED'd), but of course this doesn't impact gameplay. I'm asking $1500 but am open to offers, I'm not really in a rush to sell and am just looking to see what's out there. Cash only, pickup in Kissimmee. More pics here: https://imgur.com/a/bnoKG6y",

The games are switched by powering off the cabinet, flipping the switch to the desired game, powering the machine back on and selecting the appropriate dongle. Best part is all of this can be done from inside the coin door. The cabinet is in great shape as well and has the original massive CRT installed. The 6-speed shifter along with the steering/force feedback works great! Game is on wheels and comes apart in the center for easy moving. Spare parts are also included: memory chips, CD ROMS, parts PC, the topper pieces from an original NFS along with the original NFS game installed on a hard drive with dongle and sequential shifter (this actually gives you a 3rd NFS game!). I can ship but price varies depending on location.",

The playfield has been cleaned and waxed and is in great condition for its age. The cabinet shows some minor signs of age but remains in overall good shape. The backglass is excellent. It has new legs and levelers, along with a new power cord. This machine has been meticulously serviced: score reels were removed and cleaned, contacts cleaned and replaced where needed, new rubber installed, and a new ball added. All plastics are original or replaced as needed. The original incandescent bulbs have been replaced with LEDs throughout, with warm white LEDs beautifully lighting the playfield. A wonderful nostalgia piece for a home game room that plays very well and is ready for many more years of enjoyment. Reasonable offers accepted. Local delivery possible.",

      "title": "1992 Konami X-Men video arcade (PLEASE READ COMMENTS)",
      "description": "1992 Konami X-Men video arcade game is a retro collectible arcade gaming machine that allows players to experience the popular X-Men franchise through interactive gameplay. With Konami's reputation for quality and innovation, this arcade game offers a nostalgic gaming experience for fans of the series and collectors of vintage arcade machines. Featuring the iconic X-Men characters and storyline, this video arcade game is a must-have for any gaming enthusiast looking to add a piece of arcade history to their collection. THE GOOD: Cabinet is in great overall condition. Monitor has no issues. Joysticks work fine, might be loose for some likeness/favor but nothing a new centering grommet would not solve... and not seized for removal as I did remove to clean and made adjustments, and shafts were cleaned well so wouldn't seize in near future (for easy removal). THE BAD: Original gameboard took a dump on me, and cost to replace is hovering around $1000.00... so, I installed a Pandora's DX box (turning off all games except X-men, so boots directly into game) and wiring the player 3 and player 4 control in via two \"USB Joystick\" pcb wiring adapters. The Pandora DX does support 4 players in Konomi X-Men with only one quirk that is not an issue... when you start either player three or player four you get player three, followed by player four... no big deal at all... besides that one super minor quirk everything works as it should. To be clear, you can play a three player or a four player game no problem, and you can pick who is each... you just get player 3 controls first regardless if you hit player 3 or player 4 start, followed by play 4 controls if you hit either player 3 or player 4 start after starting a 3 player game first. I see no sound or video issues WHATSOEVER playing X-Men on the Pandora's Box DX... NONE! As a convenience, I added 4 free-play buttons just above each of the coin chutes (small red start push buttons like on 1980's midway cocktail tables, barely noticeable) on the two top coindoors for any home user purchase.... those can easily be taken disabled and the coin mechs for all four players work fine if buyer wishes to collected revenue. Will ship via freight carrier at Buyer's expense. Local pickup allowed and encouraged (zip 31525). Local delivery (from Savannah down to Jacksonville) available for nominal fee.",

Released in 1988, this sports arcade brought the fun of bowling into the arcade scene, complete with competitive play and classic retro charm. It’s a great piece for collectors or anyone looking to add a unique game to their lineup. Condition: • Cabinet is very old and needs some love. • Monitor powers on, image is good, but probably needs new caps for long-term reliability. • Lights come on. • Sound works. • Controls are functional. • Sold as-is. Highlights: • Classic Capcom sports arcade with bowling gameplay. • Upright cabinet design from the golden age of arcades. • Fully playable — monitor, sound, lights, and controls all working. • Great candidate for restoration or display in a retro collection. Important: • Price is $425, negotiable but only slightly. • Serious buyers only.",

Players can experience 7 Tales of the Arabian Nights that includes a travel around the ancient city of Baghdad, flying with the magic carpet and battling the evil genie. Rubbing the magic lamp conjure good genies that help to rescue the princess.

The game also includes spikes that rises up and save the ball when the shooting stars are summoned.",

Released in 1982 by Atari/Namco, Pole Position was a groundbreaking driving simulator that set the standard for racing games. It’s widely recognized as one of the Top 50 most historically important video games of all time. Condition: - Cabinet is very old and needs some love. - Boards need work and likely new caps. - Monitor does not power on. - Lights come on. - No sound currently. - This is a project cabinet — perfect for restoration enthusiasts or collectors. Highlights: - Classic upright racer with simulator-style gameplay. - Rare piece of arcade history from the golden age. - Great candidate for restoration or display in a collection. Important: - Price is negotiable, but only slightly. - Sold as-is. - Serious buyers only. No I don’t deliver but it can be picked up or shipped (arranged by buyer) in Powder Springs, GA.",

Serial number 1001, we believe this is the very first one ever created. It made it into the states across the Canadian Border at some point and was found in a storage unit from a collection in Idaho believed to be part of the Grinkers Arcade collection. Everything in this game is all original and working. It is running a midway Galaxian board because it is less glitchy and more reliable. We will include the original working board set which is a bootleg type board for nostalgia's sake to keep it all real. What you see in the video is the game running the original bootleg type board not the Midway version board. This game in this cabinet is extremely rare. We have not seen another one like it.",

      "description": "We have two Dead Heat racing games, selling both for $6900 or $3900 each. Dead Heat is the exhilarating, high definition, head-to-head car racing game from Namco. The game involves eight racers, and links up to four real-time players. It's not just the neck-and-neck style of this game that sets it apart, but the unique use of the player profiles and the in-game player identification gives it an edge as well. Using a PIN system like other racing games, players can store information such as high scores and friends/competitors you've played, but the profile also stores players driving styles. If your friend isn't able to make a race, no problem, just apply your friends driving style, and the computer will simulate their driving style for you to race against! Namco have also addressed the issue of trying to figure out which cars are your friends on the course by taking a snapshot of players before the race, and displays the photo above the players vehicles, making it easier to find and eliminate your friends on the track. Dead Heat Arcade Driving Game Features: 32\" LCD screen Players profiles available through PIN system to store high scores, and keep track of friends and competitors. Driving style is also stored as information,so players can race against friends who aren't present at the time. Camera on machine takes players photo before race, and displays photo above the players car during race for easy identification. 8 customizable cars to choose from (both Japanese and American).

It arrived with some playfield damage that the owner of Pinball Adventures said he'd take care of. Sadly, Andrew McBain never did honor his promises to send a new playfield. So, the game still has the damage. They were supposed to make 10 of these engraved editions but I think they only made 1 or 2. It might be one of the rarest games on pinside. If you look at the engraved edition you will see only 1 person has this game in their collection. I don't think there's another pinball game on pinside that has only 1 owner.

Excellent candidate for a 100% restore. All original! Players condition In 1980, Bally released a pinball version of the original 1978 Video game of the same name becoming the first pinball to be based on a video game. Bally's video game division, Midway, had licensed Space Invaders from Taito in Japan, and decided to capitalize on the machine's incredible success by using it as a theme for a pinball. However, few elements from the original game, except for the sounds and front case artwork, were included in the pinball game. The artwork instead resembled the xenomorphs from the 1979 film \"Alien\". Bally was sued over the game's artwork resemblance to designs by H. R. Giger. In fact, they ended up stopping production of the game early due to pending lawsuits, although 11,400 machines were still produced. A settlement was reached with Fox studios where royalties were paid to the studio for each pinball machine sold and Fox was also given approximately 3 machines to use for the promotion of the sequel to Alien, named \"Aliens\". This machine was one of only 5 \"widebodies\" released for production by Bally.",

      "title": "(RARE) Gottlieb Nudge-It Upright Arcade / Pinball Game, Circa 1990",
      "description": "This is an original Nudge-It upright arcade pinball-style game produced by Gottlieb (Premier Technology) around 1990. Nudge-It Is a distinctive and unconventional entry ir Gottlied's late-era catalog, designed without traditional flippers. Instead, gameplay relies on a spring-loaded plunger and controlled cabinet nudging to guide the ball into illuminated scoring lanes, creating a hybric experience between pinball and skill-based arcade play. From a historical perspective, Nudge-It represents one of Gottlieb's experimental designs during the final years of large-scale American pinball manufacturing. Unlike standard pinball machines, the absence of flippers was intentional, encouraging physical interaction and timing rather than reflex-based flipper control. This design makes Nudge-It stand out among collectors as a novelty machine with strong visual appeal and an approachable learning curve for casual players. Production & Rarity: Exact production figures for Nudge-It were not formally published, but collector consensus and industry references generally estimate production at approximately 2,000 units or fewer, making it a relatively low-production title compared to mainstream pinball machines of the era. As a result, surviving examples-particularly complete, powered-on machines-are considered uncommon on today's secondary market.This electrical standing arcade game by Gottlieb stands 22\" X 37\" X 57\" high at the back. The spring-attached knob releases the silver chrome ball perfectly. No flappers were designed for this arcade game. The idea was to \"nudge\" the ball into the lit lane. This electrical standing arcade game measures approximately 22 inches wide by 37 inches deep and 57 inches high at the back. The spring-attached plunger releases the chrome ball smoothly, and the illuminated playfield elements activate as designed. No flippers were manufactured for this game, as nudging the cabinet is the intended method of ball control. The cabinet, backglass, and playfield artwork display expected cosmetic wear consistent with age and commercial use.",

This is an original Double Axle upright cabinet from Taito (1990). Known for its rugged off-road truck racing gameplay, Double Axle puts players behind the wheel of massive monster trucks, battling through dirt tracks, jumps, and obstacles. It’s a rare find that captures the excitement of 90s arcade culture. Condition: - Cabinet is original and shows its age — it needs some love. - Monitor has been converted to LCD. - Lights power on. - Sound is present. - Game plays and works! Highlights: - Classic Taito racing arcade with unique monster truck gameplay. - LCD conversion makes it easier to maintain. - Great candidate for restoration or display in a collection. - A working cabinet from 1990 — not something you see every day. Important: - Price is negotiable, but only slightly. - Sold as-is. - Serious buyers only. No I don’t deliver but it can be picked up or shipped (arranged by buyer) in Powder Springs, GA.",

Try it before you buy it. I can hold up to a month with half down and rest for payment on pickup. I have to sell around 25k worth of equipment to pay for another year of required flood insurance and worker's compensation. The cinema business has finally started to rebound after the writers and actors strike but I have not been able to save any extra and the flood must be paid in full so time to list some pins and games. I am also trying to concentrate on shooting style video games so maybe a trade but really cash is best. Thanks for looking. Buddy",

Only issue is sometimes the score reel does not completely set over and you have to hit the button again to restart it. One of those Ghost in the machine kind of things that she just couldn't figure out . I have owned this game since 1979 when I received it as a kid. You might have seen this up for sale in the past and then the listing disappeared. This was a period of time when I needed money for something so I put it up for sale but then something else came through and I took it down because I didn't really want to sell it. At this point in life it is mostly just nostalgia. I just don't play it anymore. It is very fun game I am just bored with it after 45 years and want something different. Very open to trades for a newer pinball machine plus cash on my end. Thanks for looking! Nine zero four four four four one four three nine.. Dave",

The picture convergence needs help. The jet ski needs an air compressor to make the ride functional which is missing so I never could test it. There's also a piece of aluminum trim on the left side of the jet ski that was missing when I got it. The Sega Model 2 inside has been replaced so the old one is included. You will need to bring a trailer with a ramp to load it. Both pieces are on wheels so it's relatively easy to move but very heavy.",

The cabinet is in great condition, the playfield has some insert wear, but overall not too bad. The backbox and boards are very clean. The biggest knock is the back glass, which isn't great - it has a solid amount of paint loss (check the photo). Other than that, what you see is what you get. Please let me know if you'd like to check it out, or if you need any additional pics. The game has also had led's for better or worse. Pretty firm on the price",

I also have those nagging medical bills as I owe UT for life saving surgery but so happy I could be seen so quickly. Best money ever spent. Anyway I will be listening several different items and once I can get to the total I can stop. A bulk buyer like Scott Wright or Coin Op Warehouse or anyone is very welcome. I can hold for 6 weeks but need payment up front. I have heen in business since 1987 and so far never cheated anyone nor will I. I am very real honest and this is not s scam. More pics available.

Lethal Enforcers: pretty much fully working, the only issues is the heavy damage to the cabinet itself, and the player 1 and 2 start buttons are broken and would need replaced, I just didn't get that far yet Sega Turbo OutRun: This one has a working screen (imaged removed) and does not boot at all. There's power too it though and there is visual but it's garbled graphics. Lock-on by data east: This one has a dead screen and does not boot at all with a hardware error 29.

The playfield itself is in very good condition, with a little bit of flipper drag - see pics. I’d call the backglass about average condition, with a little touchup done. The main cabinet and backbox artwork is original and is very nice, with a little discoloration in the left bottom portion of the backbox front - again see the pic. The brackets and wiring for coin mechanisms are present but the removable coin mechs are not and the game is set up for free play. The playfield glass and legs are in good condition. If you’re looking for a good condition, well maintained electro-mechanical game that’s also fun to play, this would make a great addition to any collection. This machine has been kept in a climate controlled, smoke free environment and is sold as-is, where-is. Shipping is possible if the buyer makes all arrangements.",

I can hold up to a month with half down and rest for payment on pickup. The monitor looks very good. This also has the newer FGPA replacement pcb for increased reliability. I have to sell around 25k worth of equipment to pay for another year of required flood insurance and worker's compensation. The cinema business has finally started to rebound after the writers and actors strike but I have not been able to save any extra. The flood insurance must be paid in full, so time to list some pins and games. I am also trying to concentrate on shooting style video games so maybe a trade but really cash is best.

This is a dedicated cabinet featuring the iconic \"Nintendo Blue\" finish and original artwork. The machine has been recently brought back to life after years of storage. It is currently in fully playable condition and only needs a final dial-in of the H-hold coil on the monitor in order to be perfect, which I do not know how to do. All original parts with zero modifications or customizations other than bypassing the coin mechanism to allow free play (this can be reversed easily). Pickup in Concord, NC or I can arrange delivery for an extra fee after payment has been made. Cash, Cashapp, Paypal, Money Order or Cashier Check. I will also take trades on gold and silver.",

      "title": "Die Hard Full Size Stand Up Arcade Game",
      "description": "A 3-D side-scrolling fighting game based on the movie \"Die Hard\". Die Hard Arcade was produced by Sega in 1996. Sega released 594 machines in our database under this trade name, starting in 1960. Sega is based in Japan. Each SWAT member must fight every criminal and machine that they come across by punching them, kicking them as well as using various weapons and objects that they can get their hands on including handguns, machine guns, missile launchers, anti-tank cannons, knives, sticks, fireaxes, spray cans, pepper shakers, steel pipes, brooms, bottles and so on. Players can also pick up magazines for handguns and machine guns for extra ammuntion as well as health units for extra health. Also, on some sequences, players must press the Punch button, Kick button or Jump button or move the joystick in a specific direction in order to successfully get past certain enemies or obstacles. If either of the SWAT members fail on those sequences where they are supposed to punch or kick down those enemies, they will have to fight them in hand-to-hand combat.The SWAT members can also attack enemies when grabbing them and they can also arrest them when they grab them by pushing either the Punch or Kick button twice but only if the SWAT member has a handgun. When the SWAT members finally confront the crime boss, they will have to face him twice first in the office and then on the rooftop. On the rooftop, he will be armed with swords and more difficult to hurt. After, you defeat the crime boss for the second time, The President's daughter is rescued. If only one player is in the game, the girl just says \"Thank You!\" and the game ends. But if two players are in the game, after the girl says \"Thank You!\", she will want one of the SWAT members to become her new bodyguard as a thanks for rescueing her, so each player will have to fight each other until one of them is defeated and whoever wins will become the girl's new bodyguard but if time runs out, it will be a draw and the girl will be undecided about which SWAT member she wants for her new bodyguard. The game ends afterwards, regardless of the results.",

      "title": "Atari Tempest Arcade Machine – 1981 Classic Reproduction, w/ modern electronics",
      "description": "Modern Re-Creation of the Legendary 1981 Atari Tempest Step back into the golden age of arcades—without the headaches of vintage hardware. This is a brand-new machine built in the style of the iconic Atari Tempest, faithfully recreating the sights, sounds, and gameplay of the original classic. Authentic Gameplay As a Tempest champion in the 1980s and owner of an original machine, I can personally vouch that the gameplay here is spot-on, indistinguishable from a brand-new Tempest as it played in arcades back in the day. Why This Machine Is Better The truth is, the original Tempest was a maintenance nightmare. Its color X-Y CRT monitor burned itself out, circuit boards constantly failed, and many machines ended up in the dump. That’s why working originals are nearly impossible to find—and even if you do, you’re stuck battling those same issues. This machine eliminates every one of those problems, while giving you more: 24\" LCD with LED backlighting (IPS panel, any-angle viewing — no fragile CRT). New spinner with dual sealed bearings for silky-smooth precision control. 50-watt stereo sound system with subwoofer, volume control pod, and headphone jack (not just old mono sound).

      "description": "This is a true collector’s TRON arcade, not a conversion, not a replica, not a rebuild. Original 1980s Midway TRON cabinet, beautifully preserved and operates perfectly. I showed interest in selling this about a month ago but waited until I could properly assess value. After researching recent sales ranging from $6,000–$12,000, I’m asking $8,000 for this exceptionally complete, original example. DETAILS: • Original 1980s TRON arcade cabinet • Original CRT monitor (excellent picture) • Upgraded power supply for improved reliability • Cabinet in excellent condition • All lights fully functional • Lighting restored using original fluorescent and original black light (no cheap LED swaps) • Original control stick installed + extra original control stick included • Includes original owner’s manual • Includes original service manual • Includes spare NOS (New Old Stock) parts • Everything works exactly as it should This is a machine for someone who understands what they’re looking at — originality, condition, and completeness matter here, and this one checks all the boxes. Price: $8,000 Serious collectors only. No trades. Local pickup or buyer arranged freight. If you know TRON arcades, you already know how hard it is to find one this original and complete. Message me if you’re genuinely interested.",

The line is a phone issue when I try making a video, anyone seriously interested is welcome to play themselves to verify this. Hydro Thunder full size arcade game by Midway. Game functions as it should and is in overall good shape with no mechanical issues. There are some scuff marks and blemishes on the sides as it was used in an arcade for a good deal of its life. The arcade game is currently set up to play without coins, but can be changed back if you are looking to use it for income. Seat does disconnect for moving purposes and you will have to move it yourself, it’s currently in the house but there are no steps, it’s a flat move out. $1500 O.B.O.

      "description": "I am selling my Bally Fireball Pinball Machine that I have owned since the early 90's. The game was purchased from \"Fabulous Fantasies\" in California. All the chrome has been upgraded on this one to make this a beautiful collector quality pinball. The machine was completely stripped, stenciled and restored. The game plays perfectly and has the rare \"Zipper Flippers\" which open and close during various points of play. I don't play it much anymore so off to a new collector's home. It comes with an extra NOS backglass that has never been out of it's package. $4,500. OBO. I will ship if buyer pays for the shipping. I can assist with STI shipping. No trades. If ad is up, item is still available. No need to ask.",

      "title": "Nintendo HELIFIRE 1980 arcade cocktail game - ONLY 2017 Plays",
      "description": "(Located near Lexington, KY) VERY RARE cocktail version of game only 2017 plays on coin counter. Nintendo HeliFire is rarely found in the wild—it’s the rarest of Nintendo’s early video arcade lineup. It came out after Radar Scope, both released in 1980, and prior to Donkey Kong, the game that made Nintendo famous. HeliFire had the “TUB-up” designation stamped on both the cabinet top plate and the monitor frame. This example has both, so it’s definitely a legit Nintendo build and not a conversion. And far rarer, than the already much sought after upright cabinet; because cocktail are produced in a much smaller percentage than uprights. Everything is original. Has switching power supply installed, but includes the original power supply as well. All boards have been serviced: socketed chips removed and legs cleaned, all tantalum caps replaced, nearly all electrolytic caps replaced. Monitor has been recapped. It has run for multiple hours at a time in attract mode and in play, both to burn in and to flush out any potential issues with the servicing. No problems have occurred. There are only 13 acknowledged owners of HeliFire in the VAPS (Video Arcade Preservation Society) census (combined uprights and cocktails). The VAPS numbers are a bit confusing because they only specify member activity from the past three years. Current VAPS stats list 3 uprights and 3 cocktails. Of course, there are likely more examples out in the wild, as not everyone records their serial numbers with VAPS. Walkthrough vid here: https://youtu.be/7-H8C4wyWbQ?si=xUoLG-4BUlTYWABm I will palletize for $30. I have palletized and shipped numerous arcade/pinball games with no issues, and my palletizing is far better than any shipper. Guaranteed secure payment requested (cash, bank wire transfer or equivalent). Pick-up available at our Winchester, KY warehouse. FaceTime walk-through available upon request. Any questions are welcome.",

      "title": "Operation Thunderbolt Arcade Shooter Game - Fully Restored! Incredible!",
      "description": "Hey John here from Gameroom Medic! Here is an incredible, fully restored Taito \"Operation Thunderbolt\" 2-player arcade game from my own collection. It's amazing! This will make someone an outstanding addition to their home arcade and take advantage of a great opportunity! This game is awesome! Last year I performed an intensive, full restoration on this machine... ya gotta see it in person to fully appreciate. This one's from 1989 and let me tell ya, you'd think it's brand new. The coin door was completely disassembled and repainted as well as all coin mechanism parts working perfectly, along with sparkling new vinyl cabinet artwork throughout. Several improvements were made as well including new upper speakers and the addition of a mid-bass speaker and amplifier for added impact! An aluminum footrest (one of my signature mods) replaced the plastic version. New dolly-style casters have been installed. A 25\" minty fresh Wells Gardner K7000 monitor provides a stunning picture. The color is vibrant and screen is crystal clear... no burn in! The Uzi machine guns have both been completely disassembled and cleaned. New potentiometers were installed as well. The recoil feature is super fun and works beautifully! Inside the unit is equally impressive. Completely cleaned and painted along with cleaned wiring harnesses. A new power supply has been installed and main PC board fully recapped. This is without a doubt an archive quality machine, completely solid and ready for great game play. I challenge you to find this game in equal condition anywhere! No trades. Cash only. I hate to see this one go but I just don't have room for it. It's big! And heavy! Delivery can be provided but rental of a full liftgate box truck will be necessary. I will not respond to auto-generated messages such as \"is this available?\" Serious inquiries only please. I welcome your questions, and any respectable offers.",

      "description": "Experience nostalgia with this classic 1978 Bally PLAYBOY pinball machine. This machine has been given a new lease of life with a brand new playfield and cabinet decals, making it the perfect addition to any arcade or pinball collection. The machine boasts the iconic PLAYBOY branding and provides endless hours of entertainment for all ages. Don't miss out on the chance to own this timeless piece of gaming history. Notable Features: Flippers (2), Pop bumpers (3), Slingshots (2), Standup targets (6), 5-bank drop targets (1), Star rollover (1), Upper left kickback lane (the Grotto). The backglass depicts Hugh Hefner with 1976 Playmate Patti McGuire and 1977 Playmate Sondra Theodore. Tom Nieman, VP of Marketing for Bally Pinball, told us his name or initials appeared on most backglasses of this time period for which he obtained the license. On this game, his name appears on the champagne bottle. The start-up tune, Grotto tune, and bonus score countdown tune resemble portions of Cy Coleman's \"Playboy's Theme\" from the 1969 TV show \"Playboy After Dark\". An article in the Spring 2019 issue of Playboy magazine about the \"Singing Playmates\" mentioned that their producer Vic Caesar \"arranged the surprisingly famous theme to the Playboy pinball game.\" Good condition. Everything works. Will ship via freight carrier at buyer's expense... contact for quote. Local delivery available for a nominal fee.",

Everything works great including the blue lights which you can turn on and off independently.

      "title": "Williams “Big Guns” Pinball Machine - 1987",
      "description": "The \"Big Guns\" pinball machine, released by Williams in 1987, was designed by Mark Ritchie and Python Anghelo and features a unique medieval-space theme. It is known for its tall backbox with a bagatelle mini-game, a two-tiered playfield, and innovative features like catapults that launch the ball, multiple ball savers, and four flippers. The game's objective is to rescue a queen from a castle by using the \"big guns\". Key historical and design details Manufacturer and Release: The machine was produced by Williams Electronics Games, Inc. in October 1987. Designers: Mark Ritchie designed the playfield, while Python Anghelo handled much of the artwork and overall design concept. Theme: The game blends a medieval setting with science fiction, featuring a king holding a queen hostage in a castle that is attacked by futuristic military forces. Backbox and Bagatelle: The backbox is taller than average to accommodate the \"King's Chamber,\" a bagatelle-style mini-game where players can win bonuses or an extra ball by skillfully launching a ball into it. Innovations: Catapults: Two catapults on the playfield are used to launch the ball into the upper playfield or a habitrail. Four Flippers: The machine has four flippers, including two on the main playfield and two on an upper playfield, adding a unique two-level gameplay experience. Ball Savers: To make the game less frustrating, it includes multiple anti-frustration features like a kickback, a center pop-up post, and an outlane diverter. Recognition: \"Big Guns\" was well-received at the time, with Play Meter magazine calling it the best pinball machine at the 1987 AMOA show. All components of the game works including the ball on the scoreboard. All art work is in great condition. More video available upon request. Local pickup only",

I and others have played and thoroughly enjoyed this game for years now. I keep it maintained impeccably and it will have a fresh coat of wax and new glass before it leaves my shop. The MPU and PPB have been professionally rebuilt and future proofed. The power supply is new. It has a Pinsound custom sound card and a large format Color DMD. Everything on the playfield is new, the plastics, the ramp, the pop bumpers, the boat. All of it. Everything under the playfield is either new or has been completely refurbished. If you know anything about me, you know I take great pride in my work. This is no exception. Is it cheap? No. But unlike any pin that you got for cheap... this one needs nothing and had no expense spared. However, it is a good deal for the $3500 worth of parts and work that has been put into it. $4900 and this will be your new favorite pinball machine.",

It must have had cabinet wrinkle where the legs bolt to the cabinet because a previous owner covered the area in what looks like black vinyl. See pics. Otherwise, the game is in decent, solid, reliable condition. It's more of a \"players quality\" game and is priced accordingly. It was routed at some point in its life and still has the coin door lock bar & mounts to prove it. I'd never owned MB so I bought one that was on the lower end of the price range to see if I liked it. It's a fun game with easy to understand ruleset. Only putting it up for sale to help fund a grail car purchase in the near future. Pinside suggested price is $9k. I think $8000 is fair for my MB.",

The playfield was stripped down, cleaned and waxed. Old incandescent bulbs and flashers were replaced with modern LED’s in the playfield and backbox. All rubbers were replaced and coils were replaced as well. New flipper bats. New drop target stickers, new balls, New legs, bolts and leg levelers as well as new side rails were installed. Coin door was stripped and repainted. Custom inner side art installed. Cabinet art and translite are in very very nice shape for it’s age. All serial numbers matching, and only 1,985 were ever produced! This is a clean example and perfect for your man cave whether you’re a pinball collector or a baseball fanatic. Local pickup preferred in Bartlett, TN but you’re welcome to set up shipping. For an additional fee I can have the machine palletized and your shipper can pick it up directly at my loading dock. Any questions feel free to reach out!",

      "description": "Gorgeous Black Rose Pinball Machine -Pirate Themed This beautiful Black Rose, pirate-themed, pinball machine was produced in 1992 and features many unique game elements, including a pop-up twisting cannon shot to sink ships and shoot bonus shots, video-mode bonus games (uses the flippers to play a Knife Throwing, Walk-the-Plank, and Swing-from-the-Rigging analog video game), Easter-egg bonuses for trick shots, treasure bonuses, parrot bonus, etc. Play is flawless! All plastics and metals are in great condition, and the lights, cannon, analog display, 3 flippers, plunger, sound, and ball eject perform perfectly. Complete Operations Manual included. This machine has been lovingly used for home play since our purchase of it in 2008. We are a smoke free home. At the time of purchase, the machine had been completely shopped, including replacing many of the older incandescent lighting with LEDs. Some of the incandescent lights were retained to provide some of that old school pinball feel. All rubbers were replaced last year, a pinball specialist gave it a once over in December 2024, and the field was recently rewaxed. The cabinet and playfield are near flawless and the legs are free of rust. Before being returned to the States for its reshop in 2007, this machine was exported to Italy. It retains its original Italian lire coin return buttons. The game speaks and displays English (go figure!). The coin change box was missing when we acquired it, but is easily found on the internet. For an older (and more affordable) pinball game, Black Rose has so-ooo many different and unique elements and shots, that our family never got tired of it (our moving necessitates the sale). The pirate theme is exciting for both adults and children too and for those that desire, the game can be upgraded with the Skull and Bones kit, which changes the game in many interesting ways. Please message me with any questions and I will do the best I can to answer them. Play tests can also be arranged (located in Bradenton, FL). Shipping must be arranged by the buyer. Beautiful machine! Thanks!",

We had this game on route for about a year & maintained it regularly. We worked out all the quirks & it's been humming great ever since. The cosmetic lock servos are currently disabled, but can be reenabled before you purchase. I didn't snap many pics, so hit me up with anything else you'd like to see. Happy to answer any questions you may have. Come play this game at The Gamez Block in Cayce, SC today!",

      "title": "AC DC Luci Pinball Game - Limited Edition",
      "description": "I bought this from a friend on 3/7/21. An original Luci was on my list for a long time. The vault Luci has the gawd awful ugly black band around the lower playfield with all the screws holding it in. The original is the Luci to have if you can find one. Many tasteful mods including chrome stage cover, cannon, \"Luci bell\", lit train, color DMD, flipper fidelity speakers, lit topper, shaker motor, LEDs and more. See pics. This game has the jukebox mode. You hold both flippers while in attract mode and an old school radio comes up on the DMD. You press the flipper buttons L or R to tune the \"station\" and play all the songs in the game. With the upgraded speakers, it sounds amazing!",

Both has a beautiful monitor and very nice cabinet and control panel. Many other games are available. Lets do a bulk deal. Just selling multiple games to help raise some funds. A great classic that is priced less than many other arcade games I need to sell around 22k of items to cover upcoming business license and local City real estate taxes. I also have those nagging medical bills as I owe UT for life saving surgery but so happy I could be seen so quickly. Best money ever spent. Anyway I will be listening several different items and once I can get to the total I can stop. A bulk buyer like Scott Wright or Coin Op Warehouse or anyone is very welcome. I can hold for 6 weeks but need payment up front. I have heen in business since 1987 and so far never cheated anyone nor will I. I am very real honest and this is not s scam. More pics available.

A great classic that is priced less than many other arcade games or pins from this era.I need to sell around 22k of items to cover upcoming business license and local City real estate taxes. I also have those nagging medical bills as I owe UT for life saving surgery but so happy I could be seen so quickly. Best money ever spent. Anyway I will be listening several different items and once I can get to the total I can stop. A bulk buyer like Scott Wright or Coin Op Warehouse or anyone is very welcome. I can hold for 6 weeks but need payment up front. I have heen in business since 1987 and so far never cheated anyone nor will I. I am very real honest and this is not s scam. More pics available. My cell is [hidden information]. PayPal, wire cash all ok. Located in Norton Va 24273 Thanks for looking. Buddy",

For being almost 30 years old it is in phenomenal shape. I'm the second owner it has ever had. It has never been in a business or abused, and it has always been in a climate-controlled smoke free house. It has also been played less than 5700 times total Come and check it out you will not be disappointed. Let me know if you have any questions",

Backglass itself is a 7 out of 10, with some flaking and missing pieces of art along bottom edge, also has an extremely rusty lift bar that seems to have fused itself to the glass, and i didn't want to risk breaking original glass to remove and replace, it still functions just need to be gentle and lift from corners, displays are all original and work well, player 2 has some artifacting going on but is easily fixed or replace all with modern Leds should you choose, playfield is a 9 out of 10, very minimal wear, plays great! Cabinet artwork has the usual bumps and scrapes and fading for a 47 year old game, but is overall pretty nice, I'd say a 6 out of 10, these pics were taken before I swapped rubbers out and cleaned playfield and plastics, then my phone died, will add new pics when new phone arrives Important Terms of Sale – Please Read Carefully This pinball machine is being sold AS-IS, WHERE-IS with NO WARRANTY EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED.

      "description": "Stern Lord of the Rings Pinball machine. This is a beautiful example of this game. I purchased from the original owner where it was only used at home by his grandchildren. It has upgraded speakers and the upgraded, more durable plastic under the path of the dead. I have left it original other than adding lollipop rails to prevent major wear around the flipper buttons. I did add custom apron cards and can be seen in the pics. The game looks and plays great and is ready for a new home. I can provide additional pictures upon request. I prefer a straight cash sale but will consider shipping if the buyer makes the arrangements. I will also consider trades for the right games. Looking for a Joust pinball or nice example of a Junk yard. The game can be picked up on the ground level for easy loading in Surfside Beach, Sc close to Myrtle Beach. I will be listing several games this week so be sure to click my profile to see other listings.",

Not really looking for newer sterns unless it’s an Iron Maiden. This is a very nice, clean and fully functional shadow. Has new CPR upper and lower playfields installed. Playfields are beautiful with no sanctum wear. Has Mylar protection on that spot to prevent burn. Flippers and phurba diverters work great. Recently shopped with new orings and color chosen post rubbers. No broken plastics or credit dot. Ver my solid game. Aurich package is installed and is a must for this title in my opinion. Full LEDs throughout with colordmd. Cabinet is solid but does have some scuffs here and there. Looks great in a lineup but could be a good candidate for new cab decals to make it pristine. Looking to change the lineup is the only reason I’m looking to trade. Ask any questions and let me know if you need anymore photos. Thanks",

      "description": "In great shape and fully working. Minor playfield wear from normal use. All lights, switches, sounds, mechs, light saber, and features work 100%. Playfield lights have been converted to LED for improved reliability and brightness. Released in 1999, this game holds a unique place in pinball history as the final game ever produced by Williams, the last remaining manufacturer of the Golden Age of pinball. It’s also one of only two pinball machines ever made to feature an interactive hologram projected onto the playfield, making it not just historically significant, but innovative and a genuinely fun game to play. Would make a great addition to a game room or Christmas gift for a Star Wars fan. Open to trades for other pinball machines.",

      "description": "1979 Williams Gorgar pinball machine in very good condition, all original boards all in very nice condition and working and playing perfectly, no battery damage to board but will need a new battery holder installed or NVRam to save settings and high scores, I haven't done it.. just have to turn it in and off and on again real quick to boot it up.. doesn't bother me.. backglass is an 8 out of 10 with minimal wear and flaking, the original scoreboards all work, sometimes players 3-4 take a little while to warm up, sound and speech is perfect and awesome! Playfield is a 9 out of 10, very minimal wear, same with cabinet art, game has been cleaned and shopped and had leds added to GI and backbox, incandescent bulbs in all playfield lights.. I been playing it for last year and I need space back in my shop, time for it to find a new home! I also have added white carrot flippers to it ... all new rubbers and ball, waxed and cleaned and ready to rock! Gorgar was the first talking pinball machine with a vocabulary of seven words: Gorgar, Speaks, Beat, You, Me, Hurt, Got. The words could be combined together for different phrases. This may sound rather ridiculous 40 years later but was absolutely leading edge in 1979, not only for the pinball-industry but for technology in general, and nobody should forget that. Plus, after the sensational success of FLASH, it was the second SS-milestone for Williams and did a further important step to beat Bally and becoming #1 in the industry. It still ranks at #15 of the most produced Flippergames ever. Important Terms of Sale – Please Read Carefully This pinball machine is being sold AS-IS, WHERE-IS with NO WARRANTY EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED.

Theme: Cavemen; Dinosaurs; Historical Specialty: Widebody Notable Features: Flippers (4), Pop bumpers (3), 4-bank drop targets (2), Vari-targets (2), Kick-out holes (2). A video game screen is mounted at top center of the playfield. Video game time is won while playing pinball. Video play is controlled by a joystick mounted on the lockdown bar. The Extra Ball is earned via the video game. The video also displays instructions during Game Over mode. GOTTLIEB “CAVEMAN” Caveman Pinball is the first \"pinball with a video game\" design ever tried by the big 5 manufacturers. Its wide body cabinet and 3/4 size playfield also contained a video game monitor and a joystick. Its 13-inch RGB video game monitor was built into the center-rear portion of the playfield and the joystick was positioned in the top-center of the larger than normal lockdown bar. Caveman Pinball was released soon after the very popular Haunted House pinball and captured some of the deep, resonant sounds that the early '80's Gottlieb pinballs created. $1,800 PM Gary for more info Located in Connellsville, Pa 15425",

      "description": "I'm located in Hillsboro/Pevely area about 30 minutes south of downtown St. Louis. I'm selling a Creature From The Black Lagoon Pinball Machine. The machine is playable but need shopped, leds and a few things. I have too many other machines to get to and I have two more Creatures so I'm moving this one out as is. The boards are clean, no alkaline, no hacks, no burnt plugs. The cabinet is in nice shape, not beat up but just a ding or scratch here and there, great color still,no fading. If you are looking for an A list game and want to do the work yourself and save some cash this will be a good one for you. 6800.00 OBO. Cash on pick up. I don't not need to sell this so I will not take some crazy amount less. I can fold it up and do it later. The average asking price on these machines is $8350 so I'm more than fair on the price. Send me a message. Easy move out of my walkout basement and I have everything needed to help load it. No trades. I will not respond to the generic \"is this available\" If the ad is up its available",

Force feedback i think came unplugged. Worked in my mancave. Then we moved it to the shop and then is stopped. Shifter works as it should. Pedals work as they should. Monitor looks great. Solid game. Has cosmetic wear. But its time to pass it on to someone else. Located in Rock Hill SC. Price is negotiable. Will take trades on Pinball machines. Have other games I could add for the right pinball or other cool items thanks for looking.",

      "description": "If you work on your own pinball machines, these make shop work easier, safer, and way less annoying. These are purpose-built playfield stands designed by pinball repair and restoration folks to securely support a playfield above the cabinet while you work. They hold the playfield stable without resting it on cabinet rails or forcing you to lean into the machine. Printed in durable TPU (rubber-like material), not hard plastic. That means they’re tough, slightly flexible, and won’t chip, crack, or damage your cabinet or playfield edges if bumped. Why these are better than rigid stands or improvised supports: Non-marring TPU material protects cabinet rails and playfield edges Slight flex absorbs bumps instead of transferring impact Stable enough for modern playfields with ramps, upper PFs, and heavy wiring No slipping, no scratching, no stress on the cabinet Way more comfortable access for shop outs and repairs Great for: Full shop jobs and cleanings Switch and mech work Rubber swaps and wiring repairs Ramp or upper playfield removal General tear-downs and troubleshooting Details: Made from tough TPU (abrasion resistant, impact resistant) Works with most Stern, Bally/Williams, JJP, CGC, Spooky, American Pinball, and Data East/Sega games Lightweight and easy to store in a tool bag or drawer Available in multiple colors Includes: One pair (2) TPU playfield stands Color choice available These are something you’ll use every time you open a game once you have them. Clean, simple, and designed to protect your machines while making work easier.",

Gate of Doom is a hack 'n slash game which uses a top-down, isometric perspective. Players can choose between four different characters, each with their own characteristics and abilities. The player can move and attack in eight directions, as well as unleash a powerful spell once its accumulated enough magic power. Much like in Karnov, the player can pick between available spells by tapping the joystick left and right. Levels are filled with enemies and traps, as well as treasure chests which the player can open to obtain various items and power-ups which give passive boosts to the character.",

I am located in Western NC (Newland, NC 28657) and we are 25 miles from Banner Elk, 30 miles from Marion, and 1 hour from Asheville. All my pins are in a smoke free home, away from direct sunlight. Game plays perfect and has zero issues. Happy to provide any additional info or pictures upon request.

      "description": "SEGA Daytona USA 2 – Twin Arcade Machine (Working / Project) Original SEGA Daytona USA 2 twin (2-player) sit-down arcade cabinet. Commercial machine, not a replica. Very desirable setup for home arcade, barcade, or collector. Machine powers on and runs Both sides linked and playable Original steering wheels, shifters, pedals, seats, coin doors Original CRT monitors installed Condition / Notes: Game works and is playable. Occasionally the screen image freezes, which is consistent with aging CRT monitors on these Sega cabinets. Very common issue. Excellent candidate for CRT service or LCD monitor conversion, which is a popular and straightforward upgrade and greatly increases value. Cosmetic wear consistent with age and arcade use. Stored indoors. Heavy commercial cabinet — buyer must bring truck and help for pickup. Why this is a great buy: Twin cabinets are much harder to find than singles Daytona USA 2 is a classic and always in demand Perfect project with big upside after monitor refresh Price: $3,500 OBO",

Mostly complete, mostly in good condition. There is some cabinet damage at the lower back rear. This boardset is still in the cabinet, and appears to have never been removed. All screws and cable ties are still in place. Very clean, all original. No mold, no smell, no cigarette burns. Missing the monitor, marquee, foot rest, and some of the joystick handle pieces. Does have the back door, coin box with lid, owners manual and all service and schematics. Overlay is great, side art is good. Unable to test as the monitor is missing. $700 bucks Thanks Also... located in Chattanooga, available for pickup anytime or can help with shipping.",

The game will let you play all the way through, just fine. But the screen has what they call monitor fog appearing on one side. The coin mechs work fine. Everything is all there.

      "description": "WILL NOT RESPOND TO: “Is this still available?” I’m selling my Jurassic Park The Lost World arcade game to free up some space for new games. The projector bulb style tv unit has been replaced with a up to date flat screen using a VGA cable. I still have the entire original unit that can be included for someone that wants to try and get it working (just found the flat screen conversion easier). Will need new plastic housings and internals for both controllers, it will still work on the red side if you take the time to calibrate through the settings but overall to enjoy 100% they need to be replaced. It’s over 20+ years old pretty common. Serious buyers inquire only please, machine will need to be dissembled to move onto a trailer (weighs close to 800-900 lbs) and reassembled at its final location. I cannot deliver this machine and do not have a trailer, please do not ask if I deliver. Can provide in depth pictures and videos upon request.",

      "description": "COME PICK UP! From the manufacturer: The 1995 video game Area 51 is a light gun shooter arcade game developed by Messa Logic and published by Atari Games. Players take on a role of a member of the Strategic Tactical Advanced Alien Response (S.T.A.A.R.) team, fighting against an alien invasion by the Akron and their zombie-like creations at the infamous Area 51 military base. The game was known for its use of digitalized video and sprites, and it was later ported to home consoles like the PlayStation, Sega Saturn and Windows. The machine does need SOME work. I’m not sure why though. It turns on, the screen is no longer visible, you used to be able to play it for a while, it has sound. Always wanted this machine and sad to see it go. Moved into an apartment and don’t have the room for it.",
