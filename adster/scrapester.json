The original is the Luci to have if you can find one.\n\nMany tasteful mods including chrome stage cover, cannon, \"Luci bell\", lit train, color DMD, flipper fidelity speakers, lit topper, shaker motor, LEDs and more. See pics.\n\nThis game has the jukebox mode. You hold both flippers while in attract mode and an old school radio comes up on the DMD. You press the flipper buttons L or R to tune the \"station\" and play all the songs in the game. With the upgraded speakers, it sounds amazing!",

      "title": "Theatre of Magic Pinball Machine- Lots of Brass",
      "description": "For Sale: Theatre of Magic pinball machine. Asking $7900. Lots of brass. Most affordable on the internet. Located in Auburn, AL.\n\nWas in the tournament area at SFGE. It is a very reliable machine. I have replaced the trunk, decals, and glass within the last year. Playfield looks good. Plastics look good. Full LED. Recent rubber kit. Cliffys installed at the trunk and basement. \n\nThe bad: \n\nFour of the lights on the Mirror mod are not working. I have not investigated the issue.\n\nThere is a decal cover on the playfield at the drain (pictured). I do not know what is under it. I\\u2019m not going to find out what is under it. \n\nThere is some wear on the lockbar from use (pictured). \n\nThe left side on the backbox has a touched up area. I owned this for about 2 years before I noticed it (pictured).\n\nIt is a great machine. It is my most reliable pin. I am asking $7900 cash on the glass. I will not ship it. If you want it shipped, have your shipper show up with $7900, and my responsibility ends when I see tail lights. I would prefer to see this go to someone that wants this pin and not someone trying to flip it. \n\nTrades I will consider:\n\n1) The Getaway. I want one with a good original playfield. I don\\u2019t mind a little dirt, but I don\\u2019t want diamond bubbles around inserts. Obviously cash my way as well. \n\n2) Fire Champagne Edition, preferably is as rough as possible but complete. Obviously with cash my way as well.\n\n3) Fathom, also preferred to be rough but complete with cash my way. \n\nI\\u2019m having space issues, so I\\u2019m not interested in taking multiples. I would prefer a cash deal. If you have any questions please ask.",

It is a 4 Player, and I have a 12 page wiring schematic for it bc recently I was gonna refurbish it being it's a childhood relic, it's heavy, I changed all the light bulbs and rubber bands 2 years ago but there are 2 little components that kick the ball out in the front and one in the rear of the playing field that come to find out still work but lost a neutral somewhere in it's wiring hornace, and the right flipper actually just stopped last week but i suppose its something simple i just dont have the time or the extensive knowledge for old school mechanical electronics. It's all delicate but otherwise still works 75\\u0025 I'd say....would be a great conversation piece, altho the theme is really not THAT highly sought after such as a Playboy or StarWars ones,and all the new ones are all digital and don't have all these cool old school mechanical electronics like this one does and can still play today!! The playing field glass slides down and then opens like the hood of a car with a prop and all to be able to maintenance, and the back panel of the scoreboard still has the key in its panel as well as the main entry keys!! Own a piece of HISTORY TODAY!!!! Price negotiable!",

The rumble machine goes for 5k new and the wackaclown 3 player set goes for 9k new as well. Will trade for a good running truck. I\\u2019ve had these for over a year. Been in the shed since I got them from my mother\\u2019s store manager job at an arcade in Tennesee. They replaced them with newer model machines. These work great. They have minor cosmetic damage from use. They were well taken care of. Both run off of 110 power (any normal plug power) and use universal cables like a flat screen tv. Photos of the cable port are in the listing. These would make good collectibles or good resale items. I just don\\u2019t want to build shipping crates to sell them on eBay. One whackaclown machine was taken apart to put bulbs into another at the arcade. Card readers can be taken out and bypassed for unlimited play or install a coin collection to play. The bulbs and back door cover are a total of 150 on eBay. FYI these are insanely heavy machines! a",
