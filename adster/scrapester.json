      "description": "\\ud83d\\ude0d\\u2764\\ufe0f\\u2764\\ufe0f Gorgeous Black Rose Pinball Machine \\u2694\\ufe0f\\u2620\\ufe0f\\ud83e\\ude93 -Pirate Themed\n\nThis beautiful Black Rose, pirate-themed\\u2620\\ufe0f, pinball machine was produced in 1992 and features many unique game elements, including a pop-up twisting cannon shot to sink ships and shoot bonus shots, video-mode bonus games (uses the flippers to play a Knife Throwing, Walk-the-Plank, and Swing-from-the-Rigging analog video game), Easter-egg bonuses for trick shots, treasure bonuses, parrot bonus, etc. Play is flawless!  All plastics and metals are in great condition, and the lights, cannon, analog display, 3 flippers, plunger, sound, and ball eject perform perfectly. Complete Operations Manual included.\n\nThis machine has been lovingly used for home play since our purchase of it in 2008.  We are a smoke free home. At the time of purchase, the machine had been completely shopped, including replacing many of the older incandescent lighting with LEDs.  Some of the incandescent lights were retained to provide some of that old school pinball feel.  All rubbers were replaced last year, a pinball specialist gave it a once over in December 2024, and the field was recently rewaxed.  The cabinet and playfield are near flawless and the legs are free of rust.\n\nBefore being returned to the States for its reshop in 2007, this machine was exported to Italy.  It retains its original Italian lire coin return buttons. The game speaks and displays English (go figure!\\ud83d\\ude06). The coin change box was missing when we acquired it, but is easily found on the internet.\n\nFor an older (and more affordable) pinball game, Black Rose has so-ooo many different and unique elements and shots, that our family never got tired of it (our moving necessitates the sale).  The pirate theme is exciting for both adults and children too and for those that desire, the game can be upgraded with the Skull and Bones kit, which changes the game in many interesting ways.\n\nPlease message me with any questions and I will do the best I can to answer them.  Play tests can also be arranged (located in Bradenton, FL).  Shipping must be arranged by the buyer.  \n\nBeautiful machine! \\u2620\\ufe0f\\u2764\\ufe0f Thanks!",

      "description": "Experience nostalgia with this classic 1978 Bally PLAYBOY pinball machine. This machine has been given a new lease of life with a brand new playfield and cabinet decals, making it the perfect addition to any arcade or pinball collection. The machine boasts the iconic PLAYBOY branding and provides endless hours of entertainment for all ages. Don't miss out on the chance to own this timeless piece of gaming history.\n\nNotable Features:     Flippers (2), Pop bumpers (3), Slingshots (2), Standup targets (6), 5-bank drop targets (1), Star rollover (1), Upper left kickback lane (the Grotto).\n\nThe backglass depicts Hugh Hefner with 1976 Playmate Patti McGuire and 1977 Playmate Sondra Theodore. Tom Nieman, VP of Marketing for Bally Pinball, told us his name or initials appeared on most backglasses of this time period for which he obtained the license. On this game, his name appears on the champagne bottle.\n\nThe start-up tune, Grotto tune, and bonus score countdown tune resemble portions of Cy Coleman's \"Playboy's Theme\" from the 1969 TV show \"Playboy After Dark\". An article in the Spring 2019 issue of Playboy magazine about the \"Singing Playmates\" mentioned that their producer Vic Caesar \"arranged the surprisingly famous theme to the Playboy pinball game.\"\n\nGood condition. Everything works.\n\n \nWill ship via freight carrier at buyer's expense... contact for quote.  Local delivery available for a nominal fee.",

Pick up only but does disassemble fairly easy to transport.  All function but one start button and sound good but guns firing could be louder - guessing both easy fixes.",
